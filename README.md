# my_brand-project
This is my personsl website that shows my portfolio, resume, all about me and a blog.
This is the frontend built with HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript. The website also fetches information from a nodejs backend application(https://github.com/hervebu/my_brand-backend) with the help of APIs.
